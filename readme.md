# BanglaBot Documentation

## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) has seen significant development, especially in chatbots that engage in human-like conversations. The demand for regional language chatbots is rising, facilitating technological help for users more effectively. This project introduces BanglaBot, a Bangla chatbot powered by a Neural Network model. The model is designed to comprehend and respond to user queries in Bengali. The project utilized two datasets for training, covering diverse conversational contexts. Various models, including BanglaBERT, DistilBERT, and Sequential models, were employed to enhance language understanding and performance. The challenges encountered during development serve as potential areas for future research and improvement.

## Purpose

BanglaBot aims to provide a user-friendly chatbot experience for Bengali speakers, enabling them to communicate and receive information comfortably in their native language. The project addresses the need for regional language support in technology, making it more accessible for Bengali-speaking users.

## Models Used

### 1. DistilBERT Model

DistilBERT, a transformer model, was used for tokenizing data. It is a smaller and quicker version of BERT, trained in a self-supervised manner on a large corpus. DistilBERT enhances efficiency during both training and inference, making it suitable for applications with processing constraints.

### 2. BanglaBERT Model

BanglaBERT, a custom model, focuses on enhancing natural language processing for Bengali. It accurately identifies linguistic nuances, demonstrates contextual sensitivity, exhibits domain adaptability, and offers fine-tuning capabilities. BanglaBERT is designed for continuous improvement and exhibits proficiency in understanding multiple languages.

### 3. Sequential Model

The Sequential model in Keras is employed for creating neural network topologies, providing simplicity in linear stack designs. This model is used for handling intent-based responses and fallback mechanisms.

### 4. Hybrid Model (Sequential and BanglaBERT)

The hybrid model combines intent matching from the Sequential model with the question-answering capabilities of BanglaBERT. It prioritizes predefined intents and seamlessly falls back to the question-answering model for a dynamic interaction.

## Code Explanation

Detailed code explanations for each model, including library imports, model loading, features, and error handling, are provided in the documentation. The code snippets demonstrate the usage of Python libraries, Hugging Face's transformers library, and Keras for natural language processing tasks.

## Dataset Description

Two datasets, "intents" and "alldata," serve specific purposes in training chatbot and question-answering models. The "intents" dataset includes diverse conversational contexts, while the "alldata" dataset focuses on question-answering with contextual comprehension.

## Preprocessing and Training

The documentation outlines dataset preprocessing using Transformers Tokenizer and discusses the training process for the models. It emphasizes the importance of linguistic context and contextual considerations in the datasets.

## Conclusion

BanglaBot represents a comprehensive approach to NLP in Bengali, combining predefined patterns with model-driven methods for context-specific inquiries. The project utilizes state-of-the-art models, addresses challenges, and sets the stage for future advancements in chatbot building and question-answering in the Bengali language.
